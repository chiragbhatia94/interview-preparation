# Interview preparation

There are a lot of things to cover and there is a lot of depth in most topics, so in order for me to not lose my way & not get lost in tutorial hell, following is going to be my way to navigate & score a FAANG+ company.

I am going to follow BFS, Revision & then going into depth as time progresses.
